# Semantic Compression and the Theory of Generative Complexity

This document formalizes the underlying theory behind [`bitcoin-rpc-codegen`](https://github.com/nervana21/bitcoin-rpc-codegen). It introduces the concept of **semantic compression**—a framework for evaluating code generators by how efficiently they produce semantically correct implementations.

## Concept

**Semantic Compression** is the principle that a system's behavioral specification can be compressed into a minimal generator that produces correct implementations. Inspired by Kolmogorov Complexity—which measures the length of the shortest program that generates a given string—semantic compression extends this idea from static strings to dynamic, verifiable behavior.

We define **Generative Complexity** as the measurable size of such a generator, under the constraint that it produces outputs satisfying a semantic contract.

## Formal Definition

Let:

- `𝒮` be a formally specifiable **semantic target**, e.g., "correctly implement all Bitcoin Core RPC methods defined in `api.json`."
- `Δ` be a structured **description** of `𝒮` (e.g., `api.json`)
- `Γ` be a **code generator** such that `Γ(Δ) = ℐ`
- `ℐ` be the **implementation artifact** produced by `Γ` that satisfies `𝒮`

Then:

$$
\text{Generative Complexity:} \quad \text{GC}(\mathcal{S}) = \min_{\Gamma : \Gamma(\Delta) \to \mathcal{I} \models \mathcal{S}} \; \|\Gamma\|
$$

Where:

- `‖Γ‖` is the size of the generator (measured in tokens, AST nodes, bytes, etc.)
- `ℐ ⊨ 𝒮` means that `ℐ` conforms to or satisfies the semantic specification `𝒮`

---

## Motivation

- **Kolmogorov Complexity** quantifies string compressibility
- **Semantic Compression** quantifies protocol or behavior compressibility

This framework enables:

- Measuring the **efficiency** of code generators
- Benchmarking **semantic density** across ecosystems
- Tracking architectural improvement by reducing `‖Γ‖` over time

---

## Use Case: Bitcoin RPC

- Let `𝒮 = Bitcoin Core RPC interface, version 29`
- Let `Δ = api_v29.json` (the structured RPC schema)
- Let `Γ₀ = bitcoin-rpc-codegen` (the generator)

Then:

- `ℐ = Γ₀(Δ) = bitcoin-rpc-midas`, the generated Rust client
- `‖Γ₀‖` is the measured size of the generator pipeline
- `GC(𝒮)` is bounded above by `‖Γ₀‖`
- Goal: minimize `‖Γ‖` while maintaining `ℐ ⊨ 𝒮`

---

## Optimization Principle

Although `GC(𝒮)` is uncomputable in general, it can be **approximated and optimized** empirically:

If a generator `Γ(Δ) = ℐ` produces an implementation satisfying `ℐ ⊨ 𝒮`, then `‖Γ‖` is an upper bound on `GC(𝒮)`. Any alternate generator `Γ′` producing `ℐ′ ⊨ 𝒮` can be evaluated. If `‖Γ′‖ < ‖Γ‖`, then `Γ′` is a better semantic compressor.

This enables an iterative refinement process:

1. Choose `𝒮`, the semantic target
2. Encode as structured data `Δ`
3. Build `Γ₀` such that `Γ₀(Δ) = ℐ₀`, `ℐ₀ ⊨ 𝒮`
4. Measure `‖Γ₀‖`
5. Repeat with `Γ₁, Γ₂, …` under the constraint `ℐ ⊨ 𝒮`

---

## Semantic Compression Ratio

Define:

$$
\text{SCR}(\mathcal{S}, \Gamma) = \frac{|\mathcal{I}|}{\|\Gamma\|}
$$

Where `|ℐ|` is the size of the implementation and `‖Γ‖` is the generator size.

This ratio provides a **semantic density score**: how much specification-correct behavior a system expresses per unit of generator logic.

---

## Implications

- **Design benchmarking**: Competing systems can be compared by `‖Γ‖` and SCR for a shared `𝒮`
- **Version tracking**: If `‖Γ‖` drops across versions without changing `𝒮`, compression has improved
- **Research frontier**: Identifying minimal `Γ` for rich semantics `𝒮` may yield insights into optimal protocol representation

## Relation to Bitcoin Core and `bitcoin-rpc-codegen`

This project implements a real-world instance of semantic compression by compressing Bitcoin Core's RPC interface into a minimal generator:

- Source: `𝒮 = Bitcoin Core v28 RPC interface`
- Description: `Δ = api_v28.json`
- Generator: `Γ = bitcoin-rpc-codegen`
- Output: `ℐ = bitcoin-rpc-midas`

- Metric: `‖Γ‖` = LOC, AST node count, or token count of `Γ`

The semantic compression is achieved by:

1. Taking Bitcoin Core's RPC interface specification as input
2. Expressing it in a minimal generator that can produce type-safe, version-aware Rust clients
3. Maintaining semantic correctness while reducing the size of the generator (`‖Γ‖`)

Ongoing work aims to reduce `‖Γ‖` while supporting richer subsets of `𝒮` and additional Bitcoin Core versions.

## Status

This is an evolving theoretical framework. Suggestions, critiques, and extensions welcome.
